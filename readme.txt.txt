Antonio Umali HW 5 

1. ANN and KNN are to be run with the commands python ann.py/knn.py
   For the KNN, K can be specified by manipulating the knn.py file, in the main method.
   For the ANN, the number of neurons and epochs can be specified by manipulating the
   main method in the ann.py file.

2. For A*, simply type 'pythong a_star.py' in the terminal. The output of the file will be 
   the path (if there is one) consisting of the coordinates the robot will take in the form
   (x,y). The output will also include a visualization of the maze, with the following legend:

	'X' - for obstacles/unpassable cells
	' ' - for passable cells
	'-' - for cells which were considered
	'O' - for considered cells which were navigated to

   If a path does not exist then the output will say so.
